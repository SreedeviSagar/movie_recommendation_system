# movie_recommendation_system
#### Movie recommendation systems use a set of different filtration strategies and algorithms to help users find the most relevant films. The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems. 
#### Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.
